A more caring, emotional approach to a situation will help you form a better connection with your partner. Today you'll find that clear boundaries need to be established in order to keep things running smoothly between you and your loved ones.\", \"Catch the wave of activity that's spinning in your direction today, Aries. You'll find prosperity and good fortune within your reach. Expand your horizons and connect with others intellectually. Hurdles will shrink to nothing as long as you maintain a positive attitude.

You'll see your friend then if possible.\", \"People around you are apt to be touchy, Aries, so be careful how you interact with them. You'll find that they can see beyond any sort of facade and easily detect dissention within the ranks. Be honest about your opinion, regardless of how you think it will be received. This is your best approach to a certain situation, especially since the truth will surface no matter what.\", \"Mornings aren't usually your best time, Aries. You aren't fully awake until afternoon. Try not to discount the events of this particular morning, however. More than likely, you'll enjoy your best mental clarity sometime before noon. Surprise people with an upbeat attitude and a solution for every problem that comes your way.\", \"If you're single, Aries, love may come to you completely out of the blue today. The person could be standing behind you in line at the store or sitting nearby you in the park. Wherever you connect, don't be too cautious. Move ahead carefully, but at least get to know something about this person before giving in to insecurity and running the other way.\", \"Either your lover or a colleague is likely to be irritable today, Aries, which you might find upsetting. Bear in mind that this person's mood probably has little, if anything, to do with you or anything you've said or done. Just stay out of the way until your friend gets over it. This isn't a good day to host or attend social events or even accept invitations. Wait until a better time.\", \"it will clear your head and get you where you're going more quickly.\", \"Today you might complete a difficult project that's important to your career.

The level of excitement in your neighborhood is likely high, and you could get caught up in it. Be prepared for some surprises.', \"You're able to assert yourself with more confidence than usual, Aries. You should have a grounded perspective regarding your emotions. You aren't afraid to speak your mind in a situation where normally you'd only say anything that helps keep the peace. Other people may prefer that you keep things on an even keel, but you aren't working for them. You're working for yourself.\", \"Enhanced determination could motivate you today, Aries, giving you the zip to plow through your work. Finish projects that have been pending and think about what you want to tackle next. Don't hesitate to do something that feels complicated or big. You'll probably be able to handle anything, and it will feel great when you're done. Making the most of any opportunity. Enjoy your day.\", \"If you saw something in a craft shop or art studio that you'd like to buy but can't afford, consider making it, Aries. Even if you don't think you're artistic, you could surprise yourself if you try. There are resources for novice crafters. They can give you the needed support and instructions. Don't dismiss your ability. Explore this avenue and see about finding a creative niche.\", 'Today could bring a keen sense of empathy and understanding, Aries. Verbal communication is likely to be enhanced. Take advantage of this by talking through any problems or issues with important people in your life. Go to visit or call to work things out. Most importantly, express your affection for those closest to you by telling them straight out what they mean to you.', 'If you feel tired, Aries, you may need to close your eyes and listen to soothing music. You work hard most of the time, so do your body and mind some good and just relax and listen to your favorite music. Even a few minutes will make a difference. You can always use the quiet time to plan if you feel you need to accomplish something.', \"Don't fear change, Aries. Even if you think you don't adjust well, you have far more adaptability than you realize. Without change, life would become stagnant and lifeless. It wouldn't be long before you grew unsatisfied and bored with the same old thing. Try to see change as an adventure and a gateway to greater happiness and fulfillment. Trust in your versatility, too.\", \"If there's something you've wanted to take on, Aries, today's the day. There's an increase in your physical and mental strength. Dispose of any insecurity or lack of confidence and take the steps to tackle a project or goal. You have an innate ability to make sound judgments and this is what you need to trust. Take steps to get what you want.\", \"Recharge today by getting outside and stretching your arms to the sky, Aries. Be proud and courageous.

Make sure you let the world know exactly where you stand.\", \"There's an extra spark in your eye that people won't be able to ignore. Today's a good day to get your point across, because you'll find people more open and receptive to new things than usual. Speak with confidence and you'll go far. It's important for you to say what you feel. If you don't, others will find reasons to walk all over you.\", \"Get-togethers with friends or meetings with a small group, if possible, should prove informative and enlightening today, Aries, although some of it may be a bit perplexing. You may have useful information to share, but you'll probably spend as much time listening as talking. Your friends may have happy news. Don't be surprised if day's end finds you more tightly bonded than before. Enjoy!\", \"Your imagination should be flying high today, Aries. Words, images, melodies, or whatever your artistic media are probably popping into your head faster than you can keep track of them. Write them down, record them, or do whatever you can to remember them or you could very easily forget them. You don't want that to happen. Take time to do this no matter what else is pressing.\", \"Keeping things in balance today might be tricky, Aries, since your instincts may gravitate toward a loving, fanciful, peaceful situation. There's a harsh, warring force working against this position. Beware of this powerful energy that's self-centered and courageous. Stick with the things you know and don't stoop to another's level if it doesn't sit right with you.\", \"This is a terrific day for you, Aries, and you'll find that long-term trends are moving in your favor. Your sense of discipline combined with a little bit of luck is setting the stage for you to perform.

Engage in witty conversation and remember that life is an easy flow.\", \"Keep your mind open to any and all possibilities today, Aries. It's likely that you'll encounter someone who imparts valuable information. You may not realize right away just how important this information is, but it could have a dramatic impact on your life. Be prepared for anything. This is likely to be a most interesting day.\", \"This isn't a good day to invest in anything. Don't spend much time working on speculative projects, Aries, and don't put your money into anything but gold, land, or blue-chip stocks and bonds. You probably wouldn't lose everything, but it would be a long time before you saw a profit. Concentrate on what you know is secure now. There will be better days to wheel and deal.\", \"Someone, perhaps a close friend or partner, could present you with a small gift today, Aries, possibly a book. There might not be any special occasion other than your friend thought you'd enjoy it. This can bring up warm and affectionate feelings. You'll want to spend a considerable amount of time with this person. You may think it's rare to find someone so sensitive and kind.\", \"You may find that you have a strong will now, Aries. Once you get fired up to go somewhere, there's little chance that anyone can stop you. People may accuse you of being lazy or wanting to take the easy way out, but it's different this time. You should feel fired up and ready to move. The only thing that could get in the way might be someone's oversensitive emotions.\", \"your whole body does, in fact. You're either coming down with the flu or completely and thoroughly disheartened. This would be a good day to take some time off. Issues from the past may come back to haunt you. Perhaps you should address them once and for all.\", \"Praise you may receive this morning could make you feel on top of the world, Aries, but try not to let this feeling go to your head. Stay modest despite the lavish praise that may be showered on you. By evening, you won't be able to get by on just talk alone. Actions will speak much louder than words and it's important that you have some sort of plan.\", \"A couple you've known for a long time could visit you at your home today, Aries. Don't be surprised if they tell you how wonderful the place looks. Conversation should be lively and entertaining, though you should sidestep any discussion of controversial subjects. Debates on such matters could get rather heated. It might be wise to treat your guests to food rather than alcohol!\", \"Expect to fall in love at first sight today, Aries. Someone new will come on the scene and you'll feel an instant attraction. Whether it turns into anything lasting or not isn't certain, but whatever happens, you'll remember this person for a long time! You may also have a sudden interest in new forms of artistic expression and want to start learning videography or computer graphics.\", \"The tricky things to balance today are your emotions and sense of duty, Aries. Try not to let the stress of having to complete a task leak into your state of mind. The problem is that your emotions may be running away more quickly than you can handle. Meanwhile, there's a bit of a slowdown when it comes to your sense of duty and responsibility.\", \"Projects that you've worked on in the past may finally bear fruit today, Aries. Financial benefits and career advancement are strongly indicated, and you be basking in the glow of success. Don't bask too long, however. This is only the beginning! You're on a roll. Throw yourself into new projects you enjoy and you're likely to continue in this fortuitous manner for a while.\", 'even strangers. Your passion is high, so this is an excellent day to plan a romantic evening. You could also feel especially creative and want to spend your day in some sort of artistic activity. Go to it!', \"Seemingly bad news about your financial situation could throw your usually even-keeled nature off kilter. Look into the matter carefully before panicking, Aries. There may have been a computer error or other mistake, or perhaps someone confused you with someone else. Take steps to rectify the blunder. It's a drag, but you'll be relieved to know that all was better than it seemed.\", 'you just need to find it.', \"It might feel like your home has turned into Grand Central Station. Lots of family members present, deliveries made and phones ringing, and you may just want to watch TV or read a book. This could lead to some understandable irritation.

You might be frustrated, but you don't want to offend anybody.\", \"It's time to let go of the past and focus only on the future, Aries. A new person may come into your life who can help you do just that.

Enjoy this day as you anticipate your brilliant future!\", \"You're good at dealing with others, but today you should be especially so. Your intuition is strong and you're likely to instinctively understand others' thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires. You give freely of your experience, knowledge, and understanding. This brings others closer to you, which can work for you on many levels. Virtual social events may bring new friends.\", \"Finances should be going well, Aries, but your financial affairs aren't something you want to talk about to anyone now. Perhaps you want to make a decision that's yours and not influenced by others. Nonetheless, a close friend or lover is going to find out. Maybe they'll guess or maybe you'll let it slip. Don't panic. This person understands you and won't try to exert undue influence.\", \"Expect some positive changes in a current partnership, Aries. If this is a business partnership, a new agreement between you shows promise of success and good fortune. If this is a romance, you might be so perfectly compatible that you're considering moving to the next level of commitment. Any new partnership begun today should be promising and bring you whatever you hope to gain.\", \"Keeping your emotions in balance is going to be the key to a successful day, Aries.

Exercising with friends, if possible, should encourage you to keep up the good work.\", \"Someone you've never met before who you find exceedingly attractive could pass you today. You might decide to go say hello and discover not only a physical attraction but an intellectual compatibility as well. Your feelings are probably reciprocated! If you're single, this attraction might be worth pursuing. If you're involved, at least you might make a new friend.\", \"Some fascinating news could come from a friend who's presently out of town, Aries. This might be personal, but it more likely involves new discoveries in a field that interests you both. You'll probably want to do some research of your own, so be prepared to spend time in the library or online over the next few weeks. Keep careful records. You won't want to forget a thing!\", \"Today is a fantastic day, Aries, so make the most of it.

Even if you hadn't planned on it, you may want to visit an older friend or relative tonight, if possible.\", \"Circumstances beyond your control may frustrate your desire to get together with a love partner today, Aries. Work or family obligations could interfere. If your partner has to beg off, don't get upset and start doling out blame. This won't help and could put your friend on the defensive. Plan to meet another day. Absence makes the heart grow fonder!\", \"A last-minute gift that you've wanted to buy for someone special might elude you today, Aries. You could go to several stores and find the item sold out. This could be disappointing, but don't despair. There are other options.

Although there's nothing wrong with the one you're on, it's always good to consider other roads.\", \"A conversation with a sibling or neighbor could lead to you making a new friend today, Aries, probably someone who works in a creative profession.

Don't let fear or regret hold you back. Clear the path and be strong in your approach to the new and different. Stay on target and be bold in your actions. You have the ability to conquer new literal and figurative lands. Release mental blocks that might hinder your success.\", \"Things in the love and beauty department should be going rather well for you now, Taurus, so it's a good time to make a move toward the object of your desire. Make sure that you're being completely realistic in your actions. Realize that you may need some discipline in this area. Maintain a healthy structure within which you can work.\", \"they're probably right. Don't take anything at face value. There's a fanciful frenzy that's threatening to lure you into its madness. Approach things cautiously. You may discover that people are full of hot air. If it doesn't have real meaning for you, don't waste your time.\", \"Upsets in the home could occur today, Taurus. You and other members of your household are on edge and liable to snap at the least provocation. Someone could get all flustered over a minor problem and storm out. Don't worry.

Nothing will stop your penetrating eyes from seeing someone else's deceit.\", \"Your world may seem rather tight and rigid this morning, Taurus, but the good news is that difficulties are apt to melt away as the day progresses. Don't assume that opinions are fixed in stone. Things can change in an instant. Even if they seem one way at one point, more than likely they're going to manifest themselves completely differently later.\", \"Some unexpected but very welcome visitors could arrive today, Taurus. They might bring some people you don't know but should connect with right away. Expect interesting news, fascinating information, and a lot of laughs.

You'll want them to settle in and stay a while, if possible.\", \"Too many unfinished tasks may have you feeling pressured, Taurus, creating unnecessary stress. Pace yourself and don't panic if you have to let some go for now. You're probably feeling more sensitive than usual, so you might also pick up stress from the people around you. Take periodic breaks and go for a walk. This should clear your head and make things easier for you.\", \"Your talents as a psychologist could be put to work today when misunderstandings arise. Your companions aren't likely to be thinking straight and may not respond to reassurance, Taurus. Use your intuition to find the best way to defuse the situation. Finances might cause some worry right now, but your ingenuity and money sense should put things right. Go out and have fun tonight.\", \"A long-awaited event, perhaps a wedding or christening, could have you moved to tears, Taurus.

It could pave the way to more income. You could feel very proud of yourself and decide to do more with this ability, leading not only to financial benefits but also to increased self-esteem. Go for it.\", \"Just when you feel like you've come to a point of emotional stability and calm, Taurus, something happens to throw you off balance. You may be uneasy with the notion of stability and feel what you really want is risk, action, and excitement. This inner conflict makes it hard for you to operate. Try not to overanalyze every piece of the equation. The solution will come to you.\", \"it's only temporary. Do your best to take things one step at a time and make some plans for a little fun this evening. Get together with friends, if possible, or watch a movie.

This evening could be the opportune time to get together with friends, if possible.\", \"Don't be surprised if your mind goes a thousand miles a second today, Taurus. Slowing down will be difficult, and you'll have to find a way to express what's in your head. The planetary aspects lend strength to communication. Perhaps talking out your ideas or writing to someone whose insight you value will help. Even doodling can give you a place to put your thoughts.\", \"Today could bring some strong feelings, Taurus. This may not be new, as you generally tend to feel things deeply. Finding a way to express this could sometimes be tough for you. While you're creative, it isn't always easy to find the right activity to get you going. Visit an online bookstore and look for some appealing craft or art books. They may spark ideas for expressing yourself.\", 'Make your dreams valuable tools for insight, Taurus. Back in the old days, great rulers believed so strongly in the insight of dreams that they employed interpreters. Whether you think dreams are mystical insights or random thoughts, you can gain a lot from them. Reoccurring dreams are significant and can point to something that needs addressing. Consider exploring this area.', \"If you've been feeling sluggish lately, this will be a welcome day for you, Taurus. You'll feel a surge in energy that greatly increases your creativity and physical strength. Seize the opportunity to be outside for sports or a walk. Such things will direct your energy and give your mind a chance to clear. Don't be surprised if you have more focus later. Make the most of this.\", \"Difficult predicaments could arise today if you try to exert your will over others without having the most honorable intentions, Taurus. It could be that you're using someone else's fear of you to control him or her. This doesn't make for a healthy relationship. Try not to snap at others. Make allies, not enemies, and you'll find that you will have nothing to fear.\", 'Take yourself on a mental adventure today in which you explore new aspects of your world. Discuss philosophy and religion. Get to the core of a matter that seriously interests you. Now is a good time to consider taking classes or engaging in some form of higher learning.

Good luck.\", \"Things may be tough and aggressive today, Taurus, but that doesn't mean you can't make progress. There's a nervous energy in the air spurring people to action. Keep in mind that you're likely to get caught up in the frenzy and be called to take a stand. Be careful that your viewpoint doesn't become fixed and stubborn. You can learn some valuable lessons by listening to others.\", \"It may be necessary to hire a translator in order to get through to people today, Taurus. You may find that the more adamant you become, the more people shut you out. Keep things light and energetic. Too serious a tone could lead to disaster. Try not to make things more complicated than they need to be. You're holding the right cards, and now it's time to play them strategically.\", 'Your ship could come in today, Taurus. It will happen unexpectedly, and it may take you some time to adjust to this sudden financial windfall. This is a day of big changes, because you may also decide to use this money to completely alter your way of life. It could be that you make a move to another part of the country or decide to change professions. Trust your instincts, Taurus.', \"A love partner could be gloomy today, Taurus. This might be the kind of day when no matter how many times you draw your mate's attention to the doughnut, he or she still sees only the hole. The glass is always half empty, never half full. Your beloved will probably be this way all day. Don't let it drive you crazy. Try to see the humor in it. That will help you, anyway.\", \"Your intuition should be keener than usual today, Taurus, but right now you're apt to be more interested in historical figures, perhaps people associated with spiritual disciplines. Books on these subjects could not only be interesting but also informative. Insights you gain from reading about these people help increase your understanding of the present. Keep reading!\", \"Calm down today, Taurus, and be careful about accusing someone of something when you don't have all the facts. Keep your wrath under control. If you strike out now, you may find that you lose their respect forever. There are no guarantees on a day like today. If there are conflicts that you need to work out, at least make sure that it's done in private.\", \"You may be discouraged about money matters today, Taurus. Perhaps a raise you'd been hoping for didn't come through. Perhaps a professional project didn't work out as you expected. Now is the time to put your ingenuity to work and figure out a way to earn the money you need. Trust that you have the necessary know-how. A good opportunity awaits you.\", \"Things should improve for you as the day progresses, Taurus. The key is to stay loose and not be concerned with the situation's outcome. The future is uncertain. You shouldn't depend on something that may or may not pan out the way you want. There could be some conflict between you and someone with a strong ego in the morning, but this should resolve itself by evening.\", \"Today, Taurus, you might spend a great deal of time in the car running errands in the neighborhood.

It will be exciting for everyone!', \"There's a practical grounding today that may cramp your style, Taurus. More than likely you'll be aware of the time restrictions that point up your own limits. Maybe you aren't being realistic about certain areas of your life. These things will become clear today as things progress. Push through this blockage. You'll be a much stronger person once you've moved past this point.\", \"Today your desire for sex and romance is going to receive a powerful surge, Taurus. Perhaps memories of past partners will come back to haunt you, or maybe a current love interest will look especially sexy now. You're likely to be projecting glamour and sensuality, so don't be surprised if strangers notice you. Plan a romantic encounter for tonight, and dress for the occasion.\", 'Strange, passionate stirrings could find you wanting to escape from civilization with a lover, Taurus. This is a great day for it. At least plan a quiet evening at home with your special someone. You might also want to satisfy other sensual cravings, such as a desire for delicious food, drink, or comfortable chairs or beds. Flow with it. We all need a little self-indulgence now and then!', \"An unpleasant situation could arise. Your first reaction may be to protect those closest to you from the truth. You could be tempted to lie or at least avoid mentioning the situation. Don't give in to the temptation, Taurus. Your desire to shield loved ones is understandable, but it could cause problems. You can't protect people from everything. Most people prefer to know the facts.\", \"It's extremely important that you not be too possessive today, especially when it comes to other people, Taurus. You have important relationships with the people around you, and you'll find that in order to maintain them, it's best to let those people live their lives the way they want. Don't think that people belong to you, because they don't.\", \"You might have to do a lot of running around when you probably want to stay home. Obligations to friends and family are likely to come up, and even though you're a bit tired you'll want to help out. The best plan for today is to get everything done as quickly as possible and then spend the rest of the day relaxing alone. You can have it both ways!\", \"There's definitely a downside to home ownership! Much as you love projects, Taurus, the joy is tempered when the chores never end. While your home is structurally sound, it may need some cosmetic enhancement. Try adding plants and flowers indoors. Outside, a few strategically placed pots can act as attractive focal points. You can make a difference with little effort or expense.\", 'You generally are good at sizing up other people and sensing their thoughts and feelings, Taurus, but today that talent is greatly enhanced by increased intuition. You should be feeling especially enthusiastic and optimistic today. Both work and home life are likely to be looking good. Physically, you should be healthy and vigorous, and spiritually you should be strong. Enjoy your day.', \"You're likely to be in a solitary mood today, Taurus, and probably want to spend the evening reading or working on a project of your own. However, it isn't likely to work out that way. Family could drop by or some equipment could go on the blink and require repairs. Some unexpected calls could come your way. Take a deep breath and summon your good manners. You can be alone tomorrow.\", \"Have you been working out, following a new dietary program, or both, Taurus? If so, today you could look in the mirror and for the first time see some tangible and positive results. You're probably looking and feeling great. Don't abandon your efforts. You'll want to continue the progress. Keep the energy flowing by going for a run or other workout, then treat yourself to a small indulgence.\", \"You may feel like you're running into a brick wall at every turn, Taurus, especially when it comes to emotions. The intensity of the day may have you feeling like you're in a pressure cooker. Try not to blow things out of proportion. Realize that much of the drama is more a figment of your imagination than reality. Clear away the clouds and get to the heart of the matter.\", \"Finally, the world is starting to see it your way, Taurus. Be yourself and don't be squeamish about telling people exactly how it is. Your thinking is clear and focused. Use your penetrating mind to accomplish mental tasks. Your intense nature is powerful, so act wisely. Today may well be one in which other people realize that you really aren't as crazy as they first thought.\", \"Love blossoms in close relationships as communication flows freely. You're intuitive by nature, Taurus, but today you feel especially attuned to others' thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires. Don't be surprised if you grow closer to those around you. Children, in particular, should provide warmth and love. If you're artistically inclined, start a new project today.\", \"Career and money matters continue to go well for you, Taurus, and probably romance, too. Your life may be the envy of others, but you probably feel there's still something missing. This is a good day to explore metaphysical and spiritual studies. It's a time of transition, and this sort of interest can make things easier for you, especially if those close to you share your interest.\", \"Friends who are interested in psychic and metaphysical matters could contact you today, Taurus. You may discuss a lot of fascinating material, which could alter your value system in a subtle but profound way. Don't be surprised if you do more listening than talking on this occasion. It's important to soak in as much as you can. Write it down if you think you'll forget it.\", \"You'll be tested today, Taurus, so brace yourself for the unexpected. A large piece of your life is coming into question at this time, and you're being forced to face the music. Is this something that really rings true with your inner being? If it is, you should be able to deal with this challenge. If you're struggling, perhaps you should take this as a sign that you need a major life change.\", 'An online group could form today, Taurus, perhaps friends who are involved in the arts or meditation or spiritual studies. This group is likely to be close, probably through mutual interests, so communicating with them this evening should be both intellectually stimulating and emotionally gratifying. What takes place today could also bring healing of some kind, either for you or for someone else.', \"Money matters might cause you a few headaches, Taurus. You could be torn between the desire to put money aside for the future and the impulse to buy something that you've wanted for a long time. There may be a way to have it both ways. Save a little less and try to find a bargain price for your item. Take everything into consideration and work it out before you make yourself crazy.\", 'Did you forget to take two aspirin before you fell into bed last night? This morning you may feel in a fog, but it should lift around midday. You could be surprised by some heartening news from a friend or relative regarding a difficult situation that is now being resolved. Enjoy the boost of energy that this good news gives you.', \"Family who mean a lot to you can make your home an even warmer and cozier place, Taurus. You'll probably spend a lot of time fixing it up in order to receive sincere compliments. The only downside might be that your current partner may not be there due to circumstances beyond anyone's control. Enjoy the visit and invite your family to return when your partner is there, if possible.\", \"Everything may look wrong to you today, Taurus. The house doesn't look right, the furniture needs adjusting, and you probably aren't happy with the way you look either. Your perfectionism could kick in and you might plunge into action, determined to make it all right. Don't bother! There's probably nothing you can do to make it look right today. Relax. You'll see things differently tomorrow.\", \"Expect your romantic relationship to be better than ever today, Taurus. You're communicating well and in touch with one another's feelings. How wonderful to be able to maintain an inspiring, rewarding bond with someone who loves you. There is much to be grateful for. This could be a good time to take your relationship to the next level. Your partner won't mind discussing this.\", \"Changes taking place at home could lead to more income, Taurus. Perhaps a new housemate moves in, reducing your housing costs. Or you might even consider moving to a new place, perhaps one that's closer to where family members live or work. Whatever it is, it may not seem like much, but it should make a difference in your financial situation in the long run. Go for it!\", \"Don't worry about not being on the right path, Gemini, because you are. You seem to always be in the right place at the right time. There's no need to feel regret or shame about things that have happened in the past. Turn negative experiences into lessons for a better future. Even though you may not be able to change a certain situation, you can at least change your reaction to it.\", \"Slow down and take a more reserved, sensitive, and calculated approach to things today, Gemini, especially when it comes to matters involving love and beauty. You'll find a greater level of sensuality waiting for you when you're willing to open up the door even wider. Go after the object of your desire, but make sure that your approach is sensitive and disciplined.\", \"There may be a bit of opposition coming at you, Gemini. There's a light, airy feeling that's prevalent everywhere. This is definitely the kind of energy you can connect with today. There's a great deal of strength in numbers. Don't let anyone try to stand in your way. It could very well be that they are operating on incorrect information.\", \"Expected calls or deliveries may prove more trouble than they're worth, Gemini. You could get involved in endless games of phone tag, and deliveries might come when you're out. This can be avoided if you're prepared. Make sure everyone knows what you're expecting so they can watch for it. Tell people the best times to phone and be available at those times. Don't worry. You'll manage.\", \"Be passionate about the thing you love the most, Gemini. Instead of trying to eat every single thing at the buffet table, just pick one or two items that you like the best and eat them with great enjoyment. Feel free to take some for later. Don't let anyone talk you into a dish that doesn't appeal to you. You're the only one who knows what you truly hunger for.\", \"This is one of those days in which you're better able to stand back and look at your emotions intellectually, Gemini. Your freedom-loving nature isn't built to deal with heavy emotional baggage and turmoil, so don't bother trying. Be especially wary of those who seem to plop a problem in front of you and expect you to deal with it.\", \"Gemini, who's that intriguing new person in your neighborhood? What is it about this new neighbor that makes it impossible for you to stop wondering about them? Quit obsessing. Get your courage up and find a way to welcome him or her to the neighborhood. Maybe you'll find this person likable, maybe not, but give it a shot anyway. Enjoy.\", \"Emotions run high as disagreements turn into quarrels among members of a group you're affiliated with, Gemini. Stay out of it. It won't do you any good to get involved. Write your impressions and share them after tempers have cooled. You might want to make one final push toward reaching a personal goal, but forces beyond your control could block you. Try to remain patient.\", \"Someone who interests you could seem to be showing interest in someone else. This might arouse your insecurities and cause a bit of jealousy. Don't make yourself crazy, Gemini. All may not be as it seems. Try to discern the facts. Invitations to do more than one thing on the same night might force you to make an uncomfortable choice. Make the one that suits you best.\", \"An intense, emotional dream could move you so powerfully that you awaken with the odd sense that the dream was real. Write it down, Gemini. Maybe it is. Efforts to overcome obstacles and advance in business could finally pay off. You could walk around in a daze asking yourself if it really has happened. It has. Make the most of it, and don't be afraid to show your feelings.\", 'Group activities or social events in your neighborhood, if possible, could put you in touch with new and exciting people who eventually become friends, Gemini. Shared goals and interests could give rise to plans for ambitious projects. Whatever enterprises you start today are likely to prove successful if everyone involved pitches in. This evening, enjoy quiet time with your partner.', \"no matter what you have to reschedule. Your friend is in a great mood, looks wonderful, and is feeling very passionate and sexy. If you want a night to remember, don't let this chance pass you by. Also make sure you look your very best.\", \"and this might be exactly what you set out to do, figuratively speaking. Your physical energy, enthusiasm, and self-confidence are very high, Gemini. Your own and others' creative projects could take up a lot of your time. If you're coaching or helping others, however, avoid the temptation to take over the project.\", \"You have lots of energy and self-confidence, Gemini. That's wonderful, but it may also put you at greater risk for dangerous experiences and accidents. You could find that you're much more aggressive, especially if someone crosses you. An emotional irritation could manifest in physical ways like reckless driving or arguments with people who don't deserve your anger.\", \"Make some plans for recreation, Gemini. Having something fun to look forward to can make even the toughest times far easier to handle. You'll be amazed at how much you can manage when there's an end in sight. Your whole attitude lightens, so take the bull by the horns and create your own incentives. Do something special to reward yourself for the hard work you do every day.\", \"It won't be surprising if you're frustrated with a close friend or partner who's far less ambitious than you, Gemini. The energy in the air can emphasize your dynamic ways of reaching goals and achieving success. Others who are passive or fearful may be difficult for you to understand. Yet people have to do things in ways that are best for them. Try to be patient.\", 'Welcome to another great day, Gemini! The energy from the planetary aspects is positive and encouraging, especially when it comes to communicating and interacting with others. Take advantage of this. Get together with friends and family for a pleasant visit, if possible. Consider inviting people over for games or dinner or do it virtually if need be. A potluck can be fun. You work hard all the time, so play gently today.', \"Gemini, consider that artistic expression can happen in many ways. It isn't always about drawing a picture, singing a song, playing music, or acting. The way you arrange your home or workspace is an artistic expression, as are how you dress and do your hair. Each thing you do is an expression of your style. You are uniquely artistic. Enjoy this gift today.\", \"Follow your instincts, Gemini. Even if you tend to listen more to your reason, put that aside. While your ears can hear words, your intuition can hear what's between the lines and provide you with a much bigger picture. If something sounds right but feels wrong, you'll be better off trusting your feelings. Act with careful consideration and caution.\", \"Gemini, if there's something interesting that you've wanted to try, this is a great day for it. Adventure brings excitement, creative flow, and energy, which are essential to you. You're highly artistic. Continual stimulation is required to keep your psyche healthy. Experience something new today, even if it's a walk in a new place. You'll get the adrenaline you need.\", \"The fire within you is raging today, Gemini, and you should be careful how you wield this power. Be proud and triumphant. Walk with your shoulders back and head high. Freedom is important, but make sure that others don't interpret it as you not caring about a person or situation that's actually quite meaningful to you. Let your heart speak openly and honestly.\", \"Today is your day, Gemini, so live it up! If it seems like things have been rather intense lately, don't worry, they're apt to lighten up quite a bit today. Feel free to be your usual jolly self, the one who adds humor to the group. Your laughter will be appreciated. Come into the forefront. Bring things up to your level and you'll find that others willingly join you there.\", \"Some new information about an interesting field could have you browsing the web and looking through books to learn more, Gemini. This could involve law, philosophy, history, or spirituality. You could find so much that you want to take notes or make a lot of photocopies. Don't tire yourself out and try to keep track of time. You might miss dinner or get to bed very late.\", \"Conversations with a friend whose good sense you trust could open your eyes to new career possibilities, Gemini. You might think about transforming your working life. These opportunities need careful consideration, since you've never contemplated them before. There's no rush to make up your mind, so don't feel pressured. Do give it some thought. You'll probably be glad you did.\", \"Make sure that the battle you fight today is yours, Gemini. There's a great deal of tension in the air that might erupt when you least expect it. It may behoove you to stay detached from the war that's apt to ensue. Keep things light and try not to take things too seriously. Your philosophical viewpoint and strong spirit are the very combination needed to resolve the situation.\", \"A great deal of wind fills your sails today, Gemini, so set your course for a long-distance trip to an exotic place. Things are coming to a dramatic climax right now. You could find that some serious pieces of your life are taking a dramatic turn. Change is necessary for growth. If tension exists in certain areas of your life, don't fight it. Think about taking a different path.\", \"You're likely aware of your writing abilities, Gemini, but you may not realize the extent of your talent. It would be worthwhile to devote more time to your craft. You can't improve much if writing time is interrupted by other obligations. Take some time to produce something of value. Why not give it a try, even if just for a week or so, to see what you can do?\", \"You tend to be curious, Gemini, and you're always trying to learn more about your many interests. But today you could be eager to research a subject but be unable to find any information about it no matter how many libraries or databases you explore. Don't bother with it today. You'll only get frustrated. Watch some television. At least you'll get a few laughs.\", \"Happiness reigns in the home, Gemini, as everyone seems to have reached a new understanding of one another. You could also experience a new sense of peace and quiet. Everyone is concentrating more on reading and working on their own projects and less on socializing. This could be a wonderful time for you. You're getting along with your family and the house is a peaceful haven. Enjoy!\", \"You may be feeling a bit more in touch with your warrior side than your emotional side today, Gemini. More than likely this will set the stage for conflict in your world of hopes and dreams. Be careful that you aren't too aggressive toward people who are just trying to help you. The danger here is that you're most likely to hurt the ones closest to you. Be careful.\", \"If work is beginning to feel more like a burden than a joy, it may be time to rethink your job, Gemini. Your personality is such that you need lots of room to stretch and grow. If you feel stifled, you know it's time to find a new professional challenge. You're fortunate that your skill set affords you many opportunities. Choose carefully!\", \"Your emotions could feel restricted today, Gemini, a feeling that may be difficult to shake. Take this opportunity to calm down and relax. You'll enjoy the good times more when you give your body the rest it needs. Always pushing for bigger and better adventures may be fun, but it can leave you too tired to fully appreciate them.\", \"Money that you've been earning for a long time may finally come your way today, Gemini, but don't be surprised if you have to do a lot of running around in order to get it. Plans for future moneymaking projects could come up, although it's important to consider everything carefully and not jump in too quickly. This is an excellent time to learn a new moneymaking skill.\", 'Valuable and interesting information could come your way through modern technology. You might discover new information online that awakens an exciting new interest in you, perhaps related to the sciences, occult, or metaphysics. You could even discover a talent for astrology. Online group activities may also be appealing now, particularly those regarding humanitarian pursuits.', \"Your mood should be good today, Gemini, although you should be careful not to rub it in others' faces. If people don't feel like being cheerful, don't force it on them. An important sense of duty is prominent and should be obeyed at all costs. Give your adventurous nature some sort of practical grounding that you can use to be more effective regarding whatever it is you do.\", \"You're spiritually inclined, Gemini, and today you could feel especially so. You might be attracted to online meditation groups or the study of the texts of various religions. You're also likely to feel especially psychic, and you might experience some premonitions that actually come true. This is a good time to train your psychic abilities or try reading runes or tarot cards.\", \"Interesting communications from friends could center on possible world developments or maybe some juicy gossip about people you know, Gemini. Enjoy yourself, but don't take everything you hear at face value. Much of it is less actual fact than the product of someone's fertile imagination. Short journeys in your area could bring news of upcoming changes in your community. Expect the unexpected!\", \"Your mind may be going a thousand miles an hour today. You might be inundated with new ideas and information that could cause mental overload. Write it all down if you can. You'll want to refer to it later. It might be advisable to then go out for a walk or other exercise. This intellectual overload could produce excess nervous energy that you'll need to work off.\", \"Matters regarding love and romance are in your favor today, Gemini. You'll find that love comes to you when you least expect it. There's a powerful creative force within you that will be most rewarding if you put it to use for some sort of artistic endeavor. A strong yet erratic urge may call you into action, so be ready to respond with your entire being.\", \"Don't be surprised if lots of people contact you today. Perhaps you're in the mood to gossip or neighbors have news of changes nearby. You should be brimming with energy, so you can handle it, but you might find it a bit unnerving if communication gets too hectic. It's best just to go with the flow and enjoy situations like this. You can think about what it all means later.\", \"The glass may look half empty, but only at first glance. Keep looking at it, or perhaps change the way you look at it, and you'll see that it indeed is half full. You may be experiencing some frustration. Computers could be down, or communication hindered in some way. Don't get stressed. See this as an ideal time to relax since you can't get any work done anyway.\", \"Communication with close friends and a romantic partner should be especially beneficial today, Gemini, since you're feeling more in touch with those close to you. Children could also be a source of joy today. Your creativity and inspiration are strong, so this is a great day to start new projects. Your enthusiasm and optimism should propel you to new achievements. Enjoy!\", \"Today you might have a strange feeling that something is wrong, perhaps in the neighborhood or with a friend or relative. This is probably going to bother you all day, Gemini, so it might be a good idea to call this person or otherwise look into the matter. There's probably nothing really wrong, but someone close to you may have just experienced a shock of some kind.\", \"Have you been thinking about relocating, Gemini? The siren song of distant states or exotic lands may play constantly in your ears. Foreign cultures could inspire you artistically, spiritually, and personally. This is actually a time when few things are out of your reach. If you're serious about this, look into it. You can decide once you have all the facts.\", \"Bask in the sunshine of today, Gemini. Focus on the positive aspects of your life and work to expand these energies. There's a great deal of opportunity open at this time.

Have faith that you'll succeed, and you will.\", \"Give people the benefit of the doubt, Gemini. Don't be so hasty in your actions, and take the time to think things through. You have a special connection with your feelings today that can aid in clearing some of the fog in your thinking. Your sensitivity to others is remarkably strong. People will be particularly drawn to this side of you, especially tonight.\", 'Happiness reigns as you and your household embark on one or more projects that could make your home more cheerful, Gemini.

This is a good day to throw an impromptu party. Enjoy your day!', 'Romance and creativity are the driving forces in your life today, Gemini. You might find that feelings for a special person provide lots of inspiration for creative projects. Your creative energy makes you that much more attractive to the one you love most. This could prove to be an emotionally and aesthetically satisfying day. Make the most of it!', \"A rush of physical energy may hit you this morning, Gemini, and you could feel like you have no outlet for it.

Give your soul room to breathe as you take a long walk in nature this afternoon.\", \"Communication involving romance could come unexpectedly today, Gemini. You may get a loving message from a romantic partner, or you could hear of a wedding to take place in the future amongst your circle of friends.

You deserve it!\", 'Too much rigorous exercise over the past few days might have you feeling a little sore and tired, Gemini. Your nerves may be on edge, and you could be more likely than usual to snap at those around you. Try to ease both nerves and muscle aches by soaking in a hot bath. Herbal tea might also help. Accept that you should take it easy today and then do it!', \"If it's true that you reap what you sow, Gemini, you're in for a great harvest in the coming months. Your hard work and focus will start to pay off handsomely with promotions and raises just when you may have given up on being acknowledged for all you do. Hang on to your great energy, passion, and enthusiasm. Doors are about to open for you. Get ready to walk through them.\", \"A long but necessary phone call from a close friend or love partner could come at work today, Gemini. Matters of immediate concern need resolution. You might be uneasy about taking company time, and could even attract some unsettling attention, but you need to have this conversation now. It probably won't have any long-term negative effects, so do what you have to do. You'll feel a lot better.\", \"A small gathering in your neighborhood could attract interesting people, Gemini, but you may feel a little under the weather and consider staying home. Your energy may be lagging, as all energy does once in a while after a stressful time. It might do you good to make the effort and go if at all possible. It's up to you, of course, but enjoy the evening whatever you do.\", \"This could be a banner day, Gemini. Your spiritual and career goals come together so both are enhanced, and neither is compromised. It's a neat trick.

Don't discount any ideas presented to you, as one will contain the key to meshing two of the most important parts of your life.\", 'A walk through your neighborhood could put you in the middle of an unexpected, interesting event, Gemini. It may be a small public gathering or an impromptu get-together, like a protest. Whatever it is, you could be transfixed by it. Make mental notes and then write down your impressions later.', \"A war could be brewing in your world today, Cancer. Emotionally charged arguments shoot back and forth with conviction. Try not to get discouraged. Don't burn any bridges either. Remember that your words may fall on extremely sensitive ears, so use them with care. There's a very active part of your psyche that needs to be heard. Feel free to say your peace openly and honestly.\", \"You may be at a rather climactic point now in the department of love and beauty, Cancer. Your creative levels are peaking, and you might feel a strong urge to create something on a giant canvas. Realize that discipline is needed to get those artistic juices flowing. Don't let fear stop you. Initiate your dreams and let the details fall into place later.\", \"What seems like the perfect plan today may not necessarily seem like the perfect plan tomorrow, Cancer. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. There's an expansive feeling in the air that's working to catch you up in its net and pull you into its plan. Beware of get-rich-quick schemes. The wool could get pulled over your eyes on a day like this.\", \"A temporary delay in receiving some expected funds might force you to postpone a much-needed purchase, Cancer. Don't make yourself crazy over this. It isn't worth the stress. The delay is disheartening, but it isn't a cancellation. Your money will arrive, and you'll be able to go ahead with your plans. In the meantime, keep yourself busy. Hang in there.\", \"You may feel like a skipping record, Cancer. You've been scratched and mistreated, and now you continue to repeat the same thing over and over until you've driven your point home.

Relish the moment.\", \"Be happy with yourself and others, Cancer. Stop trying to find fault with everyone you interact with. By criticizing what they do and how they do it, you could wake up one morning and find that you have no friends.

It isn't your job to dictate or judge.\", \"Don't judge someone just because his or her lifestyle differs from what you consider normal, Cancer. You may be traditional, but not everyone shares your view of relationships, work, or lifestyle. While this may seem hard to understand and even frightening to you, try not to be too hard on others.

Take care of the most pressing tasks and then relax. The rest can wait. Ask family members to help.\", \"Crazy as it seems, why not plan that trip you've been eager to go on, Libra? Adventure calls, and although there are a few obstacles to stop you from answering, you can’t wait to get out of your rut. There is a great big world out there, and you can’t wait to make the time to go and see some of it!\", \"You're good at dealing with others, but today you should be especially so. Your intuition is strong and you're likely to instinctively understand others' thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires. You give freely of your experience, knowledge, and understanding. This brings others closer to you, which can work for you on many levels. Virtual social events may bring new friends.\", 'Something you might have wanted to keep between you and a few trusted friends could inadvertently be revealed, perhaps to the wrong people. Frustration and a sense of betrayal could plague you, but don\\'t turn against those who knew. Even though this can be disconcerting, you can learn from it. Benjamin Franklin said, \"Two people can keep a secret only when one of them is dead.\"', 'This is a day of fresh beginnings for you, Libra. Accomplishments in the past foster a new sense of self-confidence, along with optimism and enthusiasm for the future. Travel lies ahead in the distant future, and possibly advancing your education in some way. Romance also looks promising. Go for a facial or massage today, if possible, or buy some new clothes. Start the new cycle by making your appearance match what you feel inside.', \"You're in a fun-loving and jovial mood today, Libra, and you should make time to enjoy it with friends, if possible. The one caveat to the day is that your emotions may be a bit clouded. You may not have the most accurate impression of a situation. You might feel that people have the wrong impression of who you are. Try not to feel insecure. Have confidence in yourself and take the lead.\", \"Other people's indecisiveness could leave you feeling frustrated and stuck today, Libra. Realize that you can overcome this by pushing past them. Don't feel like you need to wait for others to make up their minds before you act. Do what you need to do, and others will catch up when they're ready. You aren't responsible for the well-being of others. Concentrate on you.\", \"If you're musically or artistically inclined, Libra, today you might have visions or melodies in your head that simply cry out to be written down. If you're a writer, you may be filled with story ideas. Whatever your creative interests, inspiration abounds. It's a good idea to start working on these projects today or they could disappear.\", 'You may feel especially warm and loving, Libra, and romance could be on your mind. Time spent with a love partner from another state or country might seem especially appealing. This is a great day to schedule an intimate evening alone with your friend and see where it takes you. All signs indicate that your friend returns your feelings, and you might end up just where you want!', \"Have you been having difficulties with career or money matters, Libra? If so, help might come today from a friend who lives far away. This person may not do much but offer words that are so insightful that you know immediately what course of action to take. What this person says could also be of valuable assistance in the future. Write it down so you'll be sure to remember it.\", \"If you've put in your time and done your homework, this day can prove very rewarding, Libra. Watch out for incredible opportunities hiding nearby. You have a great deal of physical energy today, although you may find it erratic and a bit out of control. Break free of anything that seems to be binding you. Shed the chains and live the way you want to live.\", \"You might have the chance to speak with new people in interesting fields, perhaps from foreign lands, Libra. Your conversational abilities are at an all-time high, so you'll not only enjoy talking with everyone, but they'll enjoy talking with you, too. Intriguing ideas and useful information could have your mind buzzing all night. Try to take a walk in the evening to clear your head.\", 'Matters involving communication seem to be fouled up, Libra. Messages may not get delivered, emails may not go through, and people might misinterpret your words. This could create a mess that brings everything to a screeching halt. You need to speak to people directly, give detailed instructions, use simple language, and make sure they take notes, or beware of the consequences!', \"You're in a great position to reap the rewards from all your past hard work, Libra. In the coming weeks you'll be able to realize important gains in your career and personal projects. Not only should you see significant advancements in your work life, but you'll also achieve greater personal happiness. You have great momentum, so keep it up and you'll realize your goals.\", \"A reassessment of your financial goals may be needed now, Libra. Some of your expectations may be unrealistic, and you might need to look at them in a more practical light. This doesn't mean they won't happen, just that they're apt to take a little longer than you'd like. Think of it as an opportunity to develop patience. Rework your budget and hang in there!\", \"Love matters have been going well for you recently, Libra, but today you could be alone and unable to reach a current or potential romantic interest. This could bring about a twinge of the blues, which up until now have passed you by. Don't waste time feeling down. Find something to distract you until your friend can come around to see you and you can have a little fun.\", \"You'll do some serious soul searching today. Which goals have you achieved and which ones have gone unattained? Be honest as you reflect on past months. Could you have done things differently? Would you like to do things differently in the future? You'd be well advised to write down your successes and regrets. Use the list to keep you on track. It's bound to be a great help to you.\", \"A future journey may be in the works right now, Libra. Many changes have been occurring in your life for a long time, and they continue today. They might involve group events or educational activities. This may be something you've anticipated for a long time. Your energy, enthusiasm, and excitement are high. You may be too restless to sit still. Try to get some exercise at some point.\", \"Today is a great day to act on things that have been brewing in your brain for quite some time, Scorpio. Perhaps you've been feeling unsure of yourself. It's OK to surrender and admit that you just don't have all the answers. Use this as an opportunity to restructure and rebuild. Embrace the unknown rather than fear or resist it. This is a great time to move toward it.\", \"Today is an important day in which you can breathe creative energy into a structured situation, Scorpio. You'll find that bolstering the aesthetics of your surroundings will help inspire you to be more disciplined and eager to keep things neat and tidy. Take your time and don't let other people's anxiety cause you to rush into anything you aren't ready for.\", \"Sticking close to home may leave you feeling like you're missing the boat on certain things, but you're probably better off, Scorpio. People may make outlandish promises that sound good today but will basically flop tomorrow. Stay safe and don't invest a great deal of time or money in risky ventures. Keep moving at a steady pace. You'll find success your own way.\", \"Are you waiting to hear some important news, Scorpio? Significant career matters may be involved. This isn't a good day to sit around waiting. Your call will probably come late, when you least expect it. Turn on your voicemail, get dressed, and go out and do something else for a while. Otherwise you could well drive yourself crazy hoping for the news. Hang in there.\", \"This could be one of those days in which you feel like you just can't get anything right, Scorpio. In an effort to appease other people, you may think you have to make some adjustments that make you feel uneasy. This uncomfortable feeling could turn into nervousness, restlessness, and eventually anger. Don't feel like you need to be the one to make any sacrifices at this time.\", \"Tempers may get hot today when someone says something that pierces you to your core. Address this problem right away, Scorpio, instead of letting it fester through the rest of the day. The solution requires sensitivity and caring. Let the offender know that he or she has hurt you significantly, if that is indeed the case. There's no need for you to try to hide your feelings.\", \"An unexpected communication may come today from someone connected with your career, Scorpio. This is good news, but it may be so off the wall that you could walk around in a daze for a while trying to make sense of it all. Don't agonize too much. You've worked hard for and deserve whatever it is that's suddenly coming to you. Think of it as a karmic reward. Go celebrate!\", \"Overwork and the resulting stress and nerve strain could result in tension headaches today, Scorpio. It might be a good idea to start the day pacing yourself and concentrating on the most pressing tasks. Don't worry if you have to leave some for later. There's a chance that others around you might get into some rather heated arguments. Stay out of it. This would only make you feel worse.\", \"A letter or call could arrive today bringing upsetting news about money, Scorpio. Your first reaction might be to blame yourself or someone else, but the circumstances are probably beyond anyone's control. Chances are it can be set right. Before anyone gets too upset, it's best to investigate and find out what needs to be done. It might take some effort, but all will be well.\", \"You usually place a lot of importance on self-control. Today this skill will come in handy when you receive some wonderful news that might otherwise move you to tears. Don't carry it too far. Under these circumstances, it's OK to let it out a bit. Your hard work and dedication to your career are paying off. News about possible advancement could arrive. It's a very eventful day.\", 'Surprising news about your finances and the economy in general could cause you to feel confident and secure about your financial future, Scorpio. An unexpected raise could be on the way, possibly because of sudden changes in the workplace. Some of the information may seem vague and uncertain at first, but later news should clear it up. It seems a celebration is in order!', \"Your imagination should be flying high today, Scorpio, and your creative juices flowing freely. Exceptional ideas for projects involving writing, music, or painting could pop into your head during the day. Start on one and list the others so you can refer to them later. Don't be surprised if you find your intuition increasing as well. Make the most of it all and have fun.\", \"Don't be surprised if sometime during the day you feel angry for no apparent reason, Scorpio. It's probably rooted in the past, from a situation that wasn't resolved long ago. Take a good look at what's going on today. Did some person or event awaken old traumas within you? Let them and the anger go. This can only benefit you and clear the way for more positive emotions.\", \"Different people measure success by different scales. You shouldn't get discouraged if your accomplishment today seems small compared to what others have done in the same period. Comparisons will make it difficult for you to feel like you're getting anywhere. Someone else will always do more. Be content with what you do today, even if it's something simple.\", \"Chances are that you'll feel upbeat and positive today. Share this energy with others who feel less than content. Your attitude can have a profound effect on friends, partners, spouse, and children. Neighbors and extended family can pick up on your spirit without you even realizing it. If someone is hurt or angry, be encouraging. Everything will eventually work out.\", 'Today should go well for you, Scorpio. Expect to feel a renewed energy and fresher perspective, especially concerning anything work related. Make the most of this by finishing projects that have been stalled or organizing your desk or closets. Feel confident that you can handle any task quickly. When everything is taken care of, make plans for a little recreation. You deserve it.', \"Today may find you in the mood for an adventure or a visit if possible, Scorpio. When was the last time you took a day for something like this? It's probably been too long. Not only will you enjoy it, but others will be thrilled to spend time with you, too. Whether you invite a friend along or go alone, seize the opportunity to visit people or see someplace new.\", \"You'll probably be busy today, Scorpio, and this may suit you just fine. This can really work in favor if you have some tasks to catch up on. Being energetic, active, and productive is natural for you. In fact, when you have to sit too long you probably feel restless or anxious. You may fidget, too. If you find yourself doing this, go find something active to do.\", \"Do you recognize your intuition as a valuable asset, Scorpio? Some people do and some don't. Which group are you in? It can be easy to trust more in concrete, factual reality than in the things you can't touch, yet your intuition can serve you more than you may realize. That gut feeling you experience can guide you toward greatness and alert you to danger. Trust it more.\", \"If long-overdue work has piled up, Scorpio, today is the day to dig in. This is especially so for things you weren't able to handle yesterday. Fortunately, you have added strength and mental acuity. Things will go smoothly. Make the most of this energy by not putting off anything. The pile will just grow if you procrastinate. Do what needs to be done and you'll feel great.\", \"Add more sunshine to your day, Scorpio. It may be time to stir up your inner passion and let it speak with greater confidence than you have been lately. Make sure you heal yourself by letting the people around you hear your truth loud and clear. Don't play games in order to please others. Stay true to yourself above all else.\", \"You could be asked to make some spontaneous decisions today that you might not feel entirely comfortable making, Scorpio. You could feel you don't have enough facts to make an educated decision about what to do next. Realize that sometimes it's necessary to bite the bullet and make the best choice based on the knowledge you have. Be adventurous and trust your judgment.\", \"If visitors are able to pop in and out during the day, Scorpio, you'll be in the right frame of mind to enjoy their company. Expect interesting news and stimulating conversation. At the end of the day, your mind may be going like a house afire, so it might be a good idea to take a walk or get some other form of exercise or else you might not be able to sleep.\", \"Today you're apt to feel very sensual and passionate, Scorpio. Sexy clothes, racy novels, and romantic movies could be more appealing than usual. Don't be surprised if you attract admiring glances from strangers. This is an excellent day to schedule an evening alone with a lover, although you might not be able to get together now. You'll enjoy it whenever it happens. Better late than never!\", \"If you find yourself in a slump today, Scorpio, don't worry. It could be that nothing fits right or that a certain nervous, restless energy urges you to take action, but uncertainty prevents you from knowing which way to turn. This combination could result in a locked-up feeling that keeps you incapable of any movement at all.\", \"The time has come for you to be more flexible in your approach, Scorpio. Things are changing quickly, and if you aren't prepared to change with them, you'll be left behind. Be aware of the fluctuating atmosphere around you and be prepared to make the necessary internal adjustments that help you fit in better with the external environment. Don't fear change.\", \"Today you feel in control and on top of the world. You can do anything, Scorpio. This would be an auspicious time to begin a new project or creative endeavor. You can't help but succeed but take care not to get in your own way. Sometimes you can be your own worst enemy. Believe in yourself and move confidently in the direction of your dreams in order to make them come true.\", \"Today you might be so gloomy that you don't even want to get up. It might not be a good idea to stay home, however. Try to find some tasks to distract you. At some point during the day, get out in the open air and take a walk, preferably through a park and near water, if possible. You'll get the endorphins going and lift your spirits considerably.\", \"Today you might crave the companionship of friends and lovers alike, Scorpio. You're probably in the mood for some good food, good music, and great conversation, and that's just what you'll get if it’s possible in any way. Later you might spend time alone with a love partner, reflecting on recent conversations. Some of them might be worthy of deeper thought. Have a pleasant day and a wonderful evening.\", \"You're probably feeling more in touch with your emotions, Scorpio, but it might be difficult to know which way to move based on where you are. There's an element of aggression in your world today that might aggravate your heart, making it difficult for you to get a grip on your situation. Try to calm down and focus before making any major decisions.\", \"You and your mate may be experiencing some differences of opinion. It seems you each have definite ideas about some of life's fundamental values and they aren't completely in sync. Make an extra effort to communicate, Scorpio. You may find that your values aren't as far apart as they first seemed. This rift between you will soon close. Hang in there.\", \"You may get frustrated today, Scorpio, especially in the morning when other people's egos seem to be strong. It could be difficult to relate to people who simply refuse to accept any opinion but their own. Things should mellow out by afternoon. You'll find people start to see things from your perspective. Remain confident in your position despite the vacillation of others.\", 'and more!', \"and a little scary! Don't let apprehension get to you. You won't want to let this opportunity pass you by. Your good fortune could arouse envy in some of your co-workers, but don't let this bother you either. Simply do what you need to do to get the ball rolling and then go ahead with it.\", \"Feel free to take care of any restructuring in your life that needs to be done now, Scorpio. Change may be a bit scary at first, but realize that it's a necessary variable in order to make progress. You may not have to change your focus or destination too much, but it's possible that you'll need to adjust your course to get there.\", \"A new romance may be in store today, Scorpio, perhaps with someone you've known for a long time, but you suddenly view in a new light. You could see a side of this person that you've never seen before, totally changing your perception of him or her. Any new relationship formed today shows a lot of promise of developing into a lifelong connection. The bonds involved will run deep.\", 'Relations with people on the job should be warm, Scorpio, and this could do wonders for your career. Take nothing at face value. All may not be as it seems. Someone has issues with you that render him or her untrustworthy. Take care to avoid getting too close to anyone who seems a little under the weather. Your immune system is a bit weak, and you could catch a bug.', 'only a protective one. But shielding someone from the truth can sometimes backfire!', \"It might feel like there's a hole in your heart today, Scorpio, and you could have a hard time filling it. Remember that you're the one responsible for making sure this void is taken care of. If you insist that someone else fill the gap, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Do something nice for yourself and feel free to spend a little money to make yourself happy.\", \"Frustration may be the word for today, Scorpio. You could be experiencing a bit of wanderlust. Distant states and foreign lands may beckon to you, but circumstances could make it hard for you to get away. There might also be friction with your partner. Don't get sucked into a quarrel. Use your placid nature to get grounded, then use your practicality to solve the issues at hand.\", \"Prosperity is just around the corner, Scorpio. With it comes change. Change in your job, career, or environment figures prominently today. However this change manifests, it's bound to be positive. You're lucky, and you're about to hit the road to even greater success. Savor this moment, for you'll be busy soon!\", \"During this time, you'll feel especially intuitive, optimistic, and spiritually on a roll. You could feel artistically inspired, Scorpio, and channel some of your newfound awareness into recently started projects. Your relationships are probably going well. Your increased understanding of others' needs makes you generous with sympathy or assistance where needed. Enjoy your day.\", \"Demands placed on you by work colleagues could have you stressed, Scorpio. You might feel that your co-workers are taking unfair advantage of you. This could start you thinking of perhaps going into business for yourself or with a partner. This could well be a great idea, but today isn't the day to make a decision this monumental. Wait a few days and give it some serious thought.\", \"If you've never tried your hand at the arts, Scorpio, this is the day to do it. Your imagination and ingenuity are flying high, and your aesthetic sense is acute right now. If you aren't already involved with such activities, look online to see what classes or workshops are offered. Get a friend to sign up with you. You'll probably have a great time!\", \"You may have a strange paranoia that people are out to get you today, Scorpio, but don't let this feeling paralyze you. Your emotions are more than likely getting the better of you. The reality of the situation is much different than your sensitive emotions perceive. Avoid the tendency to escape even further into this fantasy world. Stay away from drugs or alcohol.\", \"It may be much easier than usual to express your emotions to someone today, Scorpio. If there has been something on your mind for a while, now is the time to say it. You'll be able to paint a clear picture of your true feelings. Express yourself with confidence so you don't come across as helpless or clingy. Your sensitivity is a gift that others will recognize and appreciate.\", \"Today should be busy with regard to communication, Scorpio. Calls and emails to people close to you may take up a lot of your time. You could be organizing a meeting or social event of some kind. You're probably feeling optimistic and enthusiastic, and you'll likely spread these feelings to others. You're also better able to intuit what's going on with them.\", \"Erotic dreams could wake you up in a strange mood, Scorpio. You could long for a romantic encounter, but the impact is likely to be stronger than that. These intense dreams might stimulate your creative juices. If you aren't currently working on a project, ideas could flood your imagination. Let them stew for a while. There's no rush to pick one. Enjoy your day.\", \"Today, a flash of inspiration may resolve an obstacle to your career advancement that presented itself in the past few days, Scorpio. This solution could prove so beneficial that you'll want to remember it for obstacles in any area of your life for the future. You may feel so good about resolving this that you'll want to go out and celebrate. Go for it!\", \"You may find people very stubborn today, so take care, Scorpio. Arguments can explode out of nowhere, so have your helmet ready. Think before you act and don't feel pressured to get involved in something that makes you feel uncomfortable. Remember that it's OK to just walk away. No one will win the boxing match, so don't even get in the ring.\", \"Information gleaned from surprising sources could lead to sudden, fortunate career breaks, Scorpio. You might explore totally new fields, although this could be temporary. Your efforts should attract the attention of those who matter and eventually lead to advancement or a raise. Don't be afraid to continue to explore these sources. Keep up the good work!\", \"Your values could oppose those of a business or romantic partner today, Scorpio. One of you may be overly pragmatic and the other too idealistic. One seems callous, while the other seems to be living in a dream world. This could be a milestone in your relationship if approached properly. If you can't create a win/win situation, perhaps you should reconsider the partnership.\", \"With the current celestial energy, you might be going on a trip, Scorpio. It may be for business, pleasure, or both. It's likely that this trip will achieve certain goals. Perhaps you're aiming for a promotion. Chances are you'll be successful in your ambitions. Or you may be ready to set out on your own and start a new business. It's an excellent time for this, too.\", \"Are you romantically attracted to someone you know through work, Scorpio? If so, this isn't a good time to pursue it. You might be wearing your heart on your sleeve a little too obviously. This could be unsettling for your friend, and it might sabotage the results you're hoping for. Be patient and let the relationship develop. Your feelings could well be mutual!\", \"You could go over your accounts today and find that there's considerably less there than you thought. It isn't serious, but it can still be disappointing. There could be a new contract in the final stages of negotiation that will prove favorable, and you can find a way to make up for the shortfall. In the meantime, cut expenses so finances stay healthy until the new contract materializes.\", \"Today you'll realize that a clean slate brings with it the chance for a new beginning. You feel excited and optimistic about the future. Your goals are clear, and your mind is sharp. How can you not succeed? Take care not to let your fantasies run away with you. Keep your eyes on your attainable goals rather than waste time and energy chasing pipe dreams.\", \"A change in career could be in the works for you, Scorpio. It might be within the scope of your current job or an entirely new one. It's definitely a change for the better. Don't let insecurity or an attachment to your current circumstances hold you back. Whatever opportunities appear at this time may not come around again for a long while. Think about it carefully and then follow your heart.\", 'Be a bit more sensitive with your words today, Sagittarius. Your mind is apt to be especially active and even a bit restless. This is more than likely a signal to get more of your opinions out into the world. As you do, make sure you consider the feelings of others. People might have quite a different reaction to the same situation. Respect opposing viewpoints.', \"Be a bit more selective in terms of where you put your energy today, Sagittarius. Don't waste your time with situations that aren't healthy or conducive to your aims. You may find it hard to get motivated, but this is fine. This is a good day to lay low. Your energy is apt to feel rather sluggish, so be conservative with how you use it. Pace yourself throughout the day.\", \"You're riding a wave of prosperity and things are looking up for you, Sagittarius. The situation today may appear too good to be true. The bad news is that's probably the case. It may be that the truth is being masked, and that there's a great deal of speculation and hype causing a frenzy of activity. Feel free to join the frivolity but realize that the bubble may burst tomorrow.\", \"This isn't a good day to travel, Sagittarius, especially by air. Long lines at the ticket counter, endless delays, and lost luggage could be the result. This may not even be a good day to plan a trip, although you can consider your options. If you must fly today, get to the airport early, travel light, and take something good to read. That will make it bearable.\", \"You may feel a need to add some fantasy to your daily routine today, Sagittarius. Do you have someone in mind you'd like Cupid's arrow to strike? Well, don't rely on a cherub to do your work for you. Get out and do some target practice of your own so you'll be prepared when you see the object of your desire across a crowded room. Keep things light and cheerful.\", \"Don't be surprised if you leap out of bed with a spark of inspiration that wasn't there last night, Sagittarius. Let your dreams linger a bit before you face the world. This flash of genius is likely to strike quickly and unexpectedly, so keep an eye out for it, but don't consider it something that you can plan on or force into happening.\", \"An unexpected chance to fly to a faraway place, perhaps at someone else's expense, could come to you today, Sagittarius. A group might be involved, perhaps one connected with education. Do you lecture or teach? If so, this might be a chance to give a lecture in an exciting place you've never been to before. Get your materials together, pack your bag, and go. Have fun!\", \"You're probably feeling especially energetic but with little if any outlet for your energy, Sagittarius. Increased irritability and frustration could tempt you to take it out on friends, children, or your significant other. On days like this you might want to consider jogging, yoga, or aerobics. These can produce endorphins that override the stress. Go for it.\", 'Jealousy could rear its ugly head today, Sagittarius. This could involve a romantic relationship. Jealousy is often groundless, so avoid it by doing some communicating. This is the time to make the effort to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Strong emotions can work for you under some circumstances. A passionate reconciliation is better than an angry estrangement.', 'Expect some great news regarding money, possibly professional advancement. You may have to control the urge to break into tears of joy, Sagittarius. A female friend could be going through some heavy changes and might want your support. Your best course of action would be to listen rather than offer advice. You may have to try hard to control yourself, however. The situation could defy all reason.', \"Some fascinating new information, possibly spiritual or metaphysical, could come today from periodicals, TV, or the Internet. This could set you on a new course of study, Sagittarius. Your insights and revelations could prove valuable in increasing your understanding of what you read. This evening, expect a surprising message from someone you haven't heard from in a while. Enjoy!\", \"If possible, a social event could take place today involving a small number of friends you may not have seen for a long time, Sagittarius.

Possible gatherings with friends or group activities could lead to ideas for new projects that fire your energy and enthusiasm. New immediate and long-term goals should be set. Some people may not be interested and could drop out, but don't worry. Others who share your interests will quickly step in to take their places.\", \"You could feel as if the battle has begun and you're the target, Sagittarius. If you don't have a solid force behind you, this period could be difficult. Emotionally, this may not be your best day. Instead of feeling your feelings, you examine them in a methodical, rational manner. It may seem like you're dealing with them when you're really trying to talk yourself out of feeling them at all.\", \"Don't discount your excellent resourcefulness, Sagittarius. If you haven't got everything you need or all of the information required, take some time to think. Who do you know? What resources can you access? Who might know where you can find what you need? Rather than panic because the pieces aren't all there yet, make a list of contacts and go for it. Trust in yourself.\", 'Today you may feel very creative and ambitious, Sagittarius. You might want to use this energy to work on an artistic project, or you may choose to channel it into such activities as organizing your home or workspace. If you plan for it, there should be plenty of time to do both if you have a mind to. Make the most of the day.', \"Serious thinking and communication are enhanced today, Sagittarius. They're already strong qualities in you, and with this added boost, you'll need an outlet for expression. A journal is an excellent vehicle. Talking is another. If you have issues or worries, consider getting together with all involved and airing your thoughts. It's a perfect day to resolve problems.\", \"Today, Sagittarius, your ability to stand up for your decisions and not let others sway you may be enhanced. This will be especially strong if you've solved a problem. You may find that others often try to change your decisions, but not today. Things are working in your favor and you'll feel new strength as a result. Follow your heart.\", \"Use your creativity to make things happen today, Sagittarius. This doesn't have to take the form of a finished product. You can come up with new and innovative ways to approach a task, project, or problem. Trust your ability to discover such things. You're known for your sharp thinking and creative abilities. Combining them can make you unstoppable when finding solutions to almost any problem.\", \"Don't worry about being productive today, Sagittarius. You might still accomplish more than you have in a long time. The cosmic energy indicates that if you didn't get everything done that you wanted to yesterday, you're sure to do it today. Dig in your heels and go. Things will get done with time to spare. If you're into a creative hobby, work on that, too. You'll find it rewarding.\", \"You'll find that your spark can easily turn potential energy into kinetic energy, Sagittarius. Don't underestimate the power of your words. Realize the profound impact they have on others and take responsibility for their consequences. Try to use them sparingly if you can. Speak half as much as you normally would, but make each sentence resonate twice as powerfully.\", \"Emotionally, you may feel as if you're running up against a brick wall, Sagittarius. It could be that your first reaction is to drown your sorrows in drink. Escapism is only a temporary remedy.

Have some extra food on hand and see what happens.\", \"Travel of any kind might be virtually impossible today, Pisces. Airports could be jammed, flights delayed, and planes plagued with mechanical problems. If you're traveling by car, expect road construction and backed-up traffic. Stay home if you can.

They need to take out their own trash.\", \"Affection blooms in close relationships as you tune into the thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires of those around you. Communication should be clear, open, and honest without being brutal. Social events should prove especially enjoyable today, Pisces, as you're likely to attract interesting people with intriguing and useful information. Reading could also prove beneficial now. Enjoy your day.\", \"You could feel like a millionaire today, Pisces. Money matters seem to surpass your expectations. You might want to spend time fixing up your home or perhaps shopping for yourself. Do you have plans to video chat tonight? A sexy new item might make your friend's eyes pop! Increased self-confidence adds even more juice to an already enhanced appearance. Dress in your favorite colors and have fun.\", \"You could be quite busy today as friends from far away call for long-overdue conversations, Pisces. You'll probably spend as much time as you can catching up on the latest news, but don't go overboard. Your friends want to talk to you, but they aren’t judgmental. Talk about whatever is on your mind, and don’t worry about making a good impression. The truth is more important than bragging. Enjoy visiting.\", \"You might not get the things done that you want to do today, Pisces, but don't sweat it. Go easy on yourself if you still have a few unchecked things on the list tonight. People may pop out of nowhere and demand your attention for much of the time. Listen, be present, and try not to think of the things that aren't getting done. Focus on those things that are getting done.\", \"Does your house look like a cyclone hit it? Your tidy nature should drive you to clean it up. In the course of wading through the mess, don't be surprised if you discover some objects you thought you'd lost forever. Once you finish, you'll probably find that the place looks beautiful, better than it did before it was messed up. Something good can indeed come out of chaos.\", \"There could be trouble brewing in the workplace, Pisces. Some of your colleagues neither like nor trust each other and find it impossible to work together. Adjustments are needed if everyone is going to work to the best of their abilities. If you're in a position to handle this, do it now. If you aren't, distance yourself from the situation. It's the only way to stay sane!\", \"The time is right to pursue training for a particular skill or finish a degree in a field of interest to you, Pisces. Presently, great success and good fortune are indicated when you assert your considerable energy and focus on the subject matter. If you've been considering honing your communication skills, consider a writing course. Perhaps you want to organize a long-desired trip.\", \"An opportunity to increase your income by working in an artistic or innovative manner could come your way today, Pisces. Technologies like film or computer graphics may be involved. You may have doubts about your ability to take this on, but that's only your insecurity. Don't be timid. Have a little confidence in yourself. Consider it all carefully. If it seems workable, go for it!\", \"A friend may have some juicy gossip for you, Pisces. Perhaps someone is getting married. You aren't the type to put too much stock in gossip, but your friend could be so convincing that you believe everything. Be skeptical! What you're hearing may not be outright lies, but it could be exaggerated. Wait until you see the people in question before accepting it as truth.\", \"The time is right for all things financial, Pisces. If you've been thinking of signing a contract to accept a job or purchase a piece of property, go ahead. Strategize ways in which you can be even more financially successful in the future. You have a lot of skills, but you don't always apply them as carefully as you could. Correct this and you'll be unstoppable!\", \"Have you been considering working more at home, Pisces? If so, today you might decide to do just that. An opportunity could pave the way for new jobs you could do at home, in your own space, among your own belongings. This could add to your sense of security. The only downside could be if you don't make the effort, you might never leave the house. Be sure to get your workout in!\"]\n"
